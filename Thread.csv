Question 1 Clarification,bSZa17FK2l,ize3lkeNiR,2021/9/5 16:35,I think we are trying to list out the last name of the athletes that are in countries that neither have competed yet or none of their athletes have ranked in the top 3 so far.
Question 1 Clarification,bSZa17FK2l,WJrWAidLZ5,2021/9/5 20:45,Yes Elaine is correct in this response.
Conceptual question - relational state vs relational schema,Xo3aGKAsfE,ize3lkeNiR,2021/9/5 13:35,The relational schema is the structure and design of the relation such as the attribute list. The relation state is like the table content at any given moment.
Conceptual question - relational state vs relational schema,Xo3aGKAsfE,A1Kcf8Z1u3,2021/9/5 15:45,You can draw an analogy between the relational schema and classes in Java. Then you can think of relation state as the objects that are defined at that particular time.
Assignment 1 Graded,A1Kcf8Z1u3,ize3lkeNiR,2021/10/15 13:32,The numbers seem to be incorrect and it seems the points were posted?
Assignment 1 Graded,A1Kcf8Z1u3,A1Kcf8Z1u3,2021/10/15 20:02,Sorry about the mistake the correct question items were posted now.

Assignment 1 Graded,A1Kcf8Z1u3,A3mMrNEFsy,2021/10/16 0:11,Thanks Nikhil!
HW3 Q2,fk7USWbA60,A1Kcf8Z1u3,2021/10/9 10:24,You can assume that each city has a distance name so you would consider Atlanta GA to be the same name as Atlanta FL
HW3 Q2,fk7USWbA60,Xo3aGKAsfE,2021/10/25 13:45,Does this apply for Q9 as well?
HW3 Q2,fk7USWbA60,Anonymous,2021/10/25 18:21,Not sure which part you are asking but if its whether Beaverton only exists in OR then no.
HW3,bSZa17FK2l,PiQvBSPut9,2021/10/16 6:23,You can use temporal relations (see WITH and FROM) to do this rather than create temporary tables
Shuffle Deck,wUSNkrt2i7,qBhsb9AT1D,2021/10/1 17:41,I believe just choosing a random card from the deck to deal out cards is enough.
Shuffle Deck,wUSNkrt2i7,A1Kcf8Z1u3,2021/10/1 18:51,As long as there is some point of randomness that is involved it will be sufficient.
Shuffle Deck,wUSNkrt2i7,YXCMIivcy6,2021/10/3 4:32,Should we consider the situation when the deck is running out of cards?
Shuffle Deck,wUSNkrt2i7,cp5asEx6KR,2021/10/3 8:47,Yes your application should gracefully handle this situation.
Ace value,AyZm6kgtLQ,wUSNkrt2i7,2021/10/1 20:23,I think there's no specific rule in Blackjack for when an ace is counted as a 1 or an 11. I assumed we have to keep track of the total score in both cases: when the ace is a 1 and when the ace is an 11.
Ace value,AyZm6kgtLQ,RxNqRHaaoI,2021/10/1 23:22,The general rule of thumb is that the Ace will take on the value of whatever will help the holder the most
Possible legal moves,qBhsb9AT1D,YXCMIivcy6,2021/10/14 17:11,Take advantage of what the method move() returns. It is true in certain situations and false in others. You can then push depending on the value.
Possible legal moves,qBhsb9AT1D,RwKSObZt8b,2021/10/15 5:19,The move method checks if a move is legal for you. You should use this method to change the behavior of your code based on whether or not it returns true or false.
Filename changed after resubmission,loWO7ep40W,qBhsb9AT1D,2021/10/16 10:04,This actually happened to me as well on the previous assignment. I was told that I wouldn't be penalized so I think you'll be fine
Filename changed after resubmission,loWO7ep40W,QVsfnLS8nP,2021/10/16 12:01,Resubmissions with the same filename on Canvas will automatically add a -1 etc to the files. The student answer is correct in that you will not be penalized for this.
Exceptions,AyZm6kgtLQ,wUSNkrt2i7,2021/10/31 20:01,Exceptions stop execution

SQL server,cp5asEx6KR,A1Kcf8Z1u3,2021/3/21 10:59,Use homebrew to install Postgres on Mac and Linux. Download the windows installer to install on Windows.
GROUP BY query,AnRRwDoMFm,OhfDW5FQet,2021/3/29 4:47,I think it does matter. I must be after the WHERE clause and before the HAVING; LIMIT; and ORDER BY
GROUP BY query,AnRRwDoMFm,A1Kcf8Z1u3,2021/3/29 9:35,Hanna is correct. SQL first executes the FROM; then WHERE; before finally performing the GROUP BY clause

Database normalization,I8k5HwpLlU,JulFHBBgP9,2021/4/26 7:35,2NF looks at partial functional dependency while 3NF ensures no non-prime attribute functionally determines another non-prime attribute
Database normalization,I8k5HwpLlU,qjAClhRo8T,2021/4/26 8:11,Why is database normalization important?
Database normalization,I8k5HwpLlU,Rjuqf7P3nX,2021/4/26 12:41,Database normalization is important because it's a rite of passage into the database community
Java IDE,8uv1aK9btU,RxNqRHaaoI,2020/9/15 8:01,I like Sublime Text Editor and using the command line to compile

Music Industry database Trouble,WJrWAidLZ5,JulFHBBgP9,2020/2/28 7:41,Please try using the GCP instance to avoid having to implement your local copy.
Java GUI,tmt3aPs20s,fC8CoZyN8g,2020/4/1 2:35,No it doesn't matter so long as it can functionally browse the database.
Java GUI,tmt3aPs20s,tmt3aPs20s,2020/4/1 11:05,Do I need to sanitize the user input?
Java GUI,tmt3aPs20s,JulFHBBgP9,2020/4/1 14:15,You can assume that we will be reasonable users and not try to hack your system.
